# Support Files for Using R in LyX

This repository provides some (unofficial) support files for using R with LyX.

## The `scripts` directory

- `lyxknitr.R` is for the [**knitr** package](https://yihui.name/knitr) (it has already been included in official LyX, so you do not actually need it)

## The `examples` directory

Aside from the official manual of Sweave in LyX, which is an example file itself, I have a few other examples demonstrating how to use Sweave with beamer in LyX, and how to use **knitr**.

## Other files

- `add-R-path-win.R` is a dirty R script to help Windows users who are reluctant to learn what is the `PATH` variable add the bin path of R to the `PATH` variable of the system (use with care; I have no guarantee).

## Downloads

Usually I do not put binary files under version control (in GIT), so I upload them to the [Downloads section](https://github.com/yihui/lyx/downloads). You may go there for some PDF documents, which are the output from LyX in my system.

## Contributions? Comments?

I'd love to include more contributions from LyX/Sweave users; please feel free to email me or open [an issue](https://github.com/yihui/lyx/issues) here if you have any requests, comments or questions.
